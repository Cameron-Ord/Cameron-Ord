## Hi There!
I'm Cameron, A new Junior Developer based in Edmonton, AB. I specialize in online web applications. I love coding, and while I mainly build websites; alot of the time you will find me working on projects unrelated to strictly Web Development.

I'm know C++, but I am not as fluent in it as other languages(im currently working on projects that involve C++).

#### What I currently have knowledge & experience in: JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, MariaDB, Vue.js, node.js, and the DOM. I use Apache and an oracle VM for my webhosting.

I run Linux as my OS(Arch, Mint).

###  What I want to learn:
#### Java, React.js, Go(after C++)

### What I'm currently working on:
## https://github.com/Cameron-Ord/UnderrailCharacterBuilder
## https://github.com/Cameron-Ord/JsMusicGenerator

### What I want to build next:
#### A native mobile app
#### Desktop music player (C++)

### My last few projects:

Dagoth Ur Discord Bot: A relatively simple discord bot, it uses openAIs API and the chat-gpt 3.5 turbo model to generate responses. It plays it's character, Dagoth Ur. It also has some limited wiki bot functionality using bs4 and requests to scrape the morrowind page from the UESP wiki based off user input, if the user input matches any of the a tags on the page, it will supply the related link. Take a look at the code in this repo!:

Photography webpage: A fullstack application that hosts images that I personally take. It uses python and mariadb, with the frontend being Vue.js. This was my first real web application, I'm proud of it, but I still have a lot to work on!
