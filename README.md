####Hi There!
I'm Cameron, A Web Developer based in Edmonton. I specialize in online applications, I love coding and alot of the time you will find me working on projects unrelated to Web Development.

I'm currently learning c++ (just out of personal interest)

What I currently know : JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, MariaDB, Vue.js. DOM(not realy a skill or a language, but understanding how browsers work and how javascript modifies webpages is noteworthy).

What I'm currently working on:

Right now, as I mentioned, I am exploring what I can make with c++. I decided to give SDL2 a try and have been working on that.
Aside from that I plan on making a little practice Chord progression builder mobile app using ionic vue.js and capacitor.

My last few projects:

Dagoth Ur Discord Bot: A relatively simple discord bot, it uses openAIs API and the chat-gpt 3.5 turbo model to generate responses. It plays it's character, Dagoth Ur. It also has some limited wiki bot functionality using bs4 and requests to scrape the morrowind page from the UESP wiki based off user input, if the user input matches any of the a tags on the page, it will supply the related link.

Photography webpage: A fullstack application that hosts images that I personally take. It uses python and mariadb, with the frontend being Vue.js. This was my first real web application, it could be nicer, but i'm proud of it! https://photography.cameron-ord.online/#/

Online portfolio: A simple frontend deployment, lists my projects, skills, tied together with a nice about me. You can view my projects and their respective websites(if they have one), as well as download my CV, and view my linkedin or github.
