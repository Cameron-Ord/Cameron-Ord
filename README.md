Hi There!
I'm Cameron, A new Junior Developer based in Edmonton, AB. I specialize in online web applications. I love coding, and while I mainly build websites; alot of the time you will find me working on projects unrelated to strictly Web Development.

I'm know C, C++ on a basic level.

What I currently have knowledge & experience in: JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, MariaDB, Vue.js, node.js, and the DOM. I use Apache and an oracle VM for my webhosting.

I run Linux as my OS(Arch, Mint).

What I'm currently working on:

Right now, as I mentioned, I am exploring what I can make with c++. I decided to give SDL2 a try and have been working on that. 
I am also working on a python/C++ project that uses python for the GUI and runs C++ as a subprocess. The goal of the end product is to be a desktop executable application that a user can use to generate a viable build in the video game Underrail based off some selectors and inputs.

After this project I intend to move on to building a native mobile app using Ionic and Capacitor. My idea right now is for a songwriting assistant app, with the main functionality being a chord progression calculator the dynamically changes based off the chords of a key/scale the user chooses. 

My last few projects:

Dagoth Ur Discord Bot: A relatively simple discord bot, it uses openAIs API and the chat-gpt 3.5 turbo model to generate responses. It plays it's character, Dagoth Ur. It also has some limited wiki bot functionality using bs4 and requests to scrape the morrowind page from the UESP wiki based off user input, if the user input matches any of the a tags on the page, it will supply the related link. Take a look at the code in this repo!: https://github.com/Cameron-Ord/Dagoth-Discord-Bot

Photography webpage: A fullstack application that hosts images that I personally take. It uses python and mariadb, with the frontend being Vue.js. This was my first real web application, I'm proud of it, but I still have a lot to work on! https://photography.cameron-ord.online/#/

Online portfolio: A simple frontend deployment, lists my projects, skills, tied together with a nice about me. You can view my projects and their respective websites(if they have one), as well as download my CV, and view my linkedin or github. https://portfolio.cameron-ord.online/#/
