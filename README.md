# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm just a guy that programs for fun.

## My favourite languages:
- **C/C++**
- **Go**
- **Python**

## Languages I(kind of) am learning:
- **Rust**

## My goals:
Make a pretty good graphical text editor in C using SDL with some OpenGL potentially mixed in along with it. (Not really a strong requirement though as i want to finish it). The goal is to implement nice text editing features, not special effects.

Mess around with the wayland protocol and see if i am not stupid enough to do something with it using wlroots.
